## Research Lab Notebook

1. DNA Extraction and PCR amplification: by Lab protocols

2. Sending PCR to sequencing facility: 

3. Assembly of sequences received:

4. - Make names! file on a text editor, including names (with locality and barcode) to match with sequences (ab1files).
   - Ingi: uses Phred & Phrap

5. Proofreading of sequences: on Mesquite

   Guide here: http://mesquiteproject.org/packages/chromaseq/manual/quality.html

   - Start with high quality paired reads first (light green)
